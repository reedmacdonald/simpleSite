        Hello, I'm a software engineer who has worked primarily as a front-end developer for several years. In my spare time I've been exploring some technologies like <span class='tool-tip' data-tool-tip="I really like Ruby on Rails, wish I had discovered it earlier">Ruby</span> and Python while also solidifying my front-end <span class='tool-tip' data-tool-tip="You may have noticed that I shamelessly stole this color scheme from Codacademy">fundamentals</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Outside of coding, I enjoy doing other things.
