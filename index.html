        Hello, I'm a software engineer who has worked primarily as a front-end developer. I've written code for companies like Microsoft, Apple, and the US Army and am currently devoting my time to diving into AI and cloud computing.
    </p>

    <p>
        Outside of coding, I enjoy doing other things.
    </p>
