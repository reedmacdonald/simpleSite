        Hello, I'm a software engineer who has worked primarily as a front-end developer for several years, most recently for Microsoft, specializing in React and TypeScript. I've also worked professionally with Wordpress and React-Native and done styling in a myriad of ways including SCSS modules and <span class='tool-tip' data-tool-tip="Styled-Components work well for React, though I generally prefer to separate styling from substance">CSS-in-JS</span>. In my spare time I've decided both to explore some technologies like <span class='tool-tip' data-tool-tip="I really like Ruby on Rails, wish I had discovered it earlier">Ruby</span> and Python while also solidifying my front-end <span class='tool-tip' data-tool-tip="You may have noticed that I shamelessly stole this color scheme from Codacademy">fundamentals</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Prior to coding, I was a Political Science major at UCLA and had five internships, most <span class='tool-tip' data-tool-tip="I also interned in Senator Feinstein's LA office, though she was only there once">notably</span> for Congressman Alan Lowenthal's office in Washington, DC. Outside of work I enjoy playing chess, doing improv, and watching Bayern <span class='tool-tip' data-tool-tip="Hopefully they buy a striker and get back to their treble-winning ways">Munich</span> soccer.
